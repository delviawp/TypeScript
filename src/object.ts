const person = {
    name: 'Delvia',
    age: 26
}

console.log(person.name)

// console.log(person.address) TypeScript will know we dont have this property
// when you hover the variable it will show what property we have and value we have
// for object is pretty much the same with javascript, we can also make it more specific
// but its going to be really redundant and not the best practice.
